I'm stressing right now, 

but I'm learning new things.... 

It's pretty cool.

I hope I grasp the concept of Git...

I notice the more I'm using Git, the more comfortable I am using it 

Its tedious, but I'm used to this kind of work...

I worked for a billing company for 7 years...

half my job was data entry... 

The other half was scanning EOB's, Charges, and Demographics into the system.

I kind of miss working there, but it was time to move on to a career with a reliable salary... which is why I'm going to school.
